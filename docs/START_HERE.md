pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the Tracker (1 minute)
```bash
python pricedive.py
```

**That's it!** The script will:

### Step 3: Check the Results
Look for these files:

## 🎨 Try the Hook Chart

Generate the attention-grabbing V-curve chart:
```bash
python generate_hook_chart.py
```

This creates `v_curve_example.png` showing how sellers manipulate prices before sales!

---

## ⚙️ Customize for Your Needs

### 1. Edit Your Configuration
Open `config.json` in any text editor:

```json
{
  "product_name": "iPhone 15 Pro 256GB",
  "targets": [
    {
      "platform": "Taobao",
      "url": "https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=YOUR_ID"
    }
  ],
  "twitter_api_keys": {
    "consumer_key": "YOUR_KEY",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Change:**
- `product_name` - The product you want to track
- `url` - The actual product page URL
- Add more platforms by copying the `targets` entries

### 2. Get Twitter API Keys (Optional)

To post to Twitter:
1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/
2. Create a developer account
3. Generate API keys
4. Add them to `config.json`

**Note:** The app works fine without Twitter! It will just skip posting.

### 3. Implement Real Scraping

The default version uses **simulated prices** for testing. To track real prices:

1. Open `pricedive.py` in an editor
2. Find the `fetch_price()` function (around line 125)
3. Follow the detailed comments to implement real scraping
4. See **USAGE.md** for complete examples
